# ezhttp
A HTTP client library with freaken easy interfaces, built for Lua, backed up by libuv/luv. I don't like callbacks but I do need async interfaces, so this one will be designed with async/wait pattern.

这将是一个基于libuv/luv开发的HTTP客户端库，主要为了实现三个特性：
1. 具有简单（到令人发指）的接口
2. 支持（天经地义的）异步I/O
3. 不使用（丧心病狂的）回调函数机制

Have fun!

This is a private project built for fun (obviously) and just get started. I'd suggest you to not trust any of my code at this stage.
